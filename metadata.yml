Title: BBBP model tested on marine-derived kinase inhibitors
Description: A set of three binary classifiers (random forest, gradient boosting classifier,
  and logistic regression) to predict the Blood-Brain Barrier
  (BBB) permeability of small organic compounds. The best models were applied to natural
  products of marine origin, able to inhibit kinases associated with neurodegenerative
  disorders. The training set size was around 300 compounds.
Mode: 'Retrained'
Task: 'Classification'
Input: 'Compound'
Input Shape: 'Single'
Output: 'Probability'
Output Type: 'Float'
Output Shape: 'List'
Interpretation: 'Classification score over three classifiers, namely random forest (rfc), gradient boosting classifier (gbc), and logistic regression (logres).'
