Title: BBBP model tested on marine-derived kinase inhibitors
Description: Developed binary ensemble classifiers to predict the Blood-Brain Barrier
  (BBB) permeability of small organic compounds. Applied our best models to natural
  products of marine origin, able to inhibit kinases associated with neurodegenerative
  disorders.
